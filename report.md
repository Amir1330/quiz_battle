### Recent Bug Fixes

#### Quiz Game Screen State Management
Fixed a critical issue where `setState()` was being called during the widget build phase. The solution involved:

1. Adding a `_showingDialog` flag to prevent multiple dialog displays
2. Implementing `didChangeDependencies()` lifecycle method
3. Using `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` for safe dialog display
4. Moving dialog display logic out of the build method

```dart
void _maybeShowResults() {
  if (_currentQuestionIndex >= widget.quiz.questions.length && !_showingDialog) {
    _showingDialog = true;
    final language = context.read<SettingsProvider>().language;
    
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        barrierDismissible: false,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          // Dialog content
        ),
      );
    });
  }
}
```
